Bufstop is a plugin for fast buffer switching, built for efficiency and less keystrokes.

Source: https://github.com/mihaifm/bufstop
Demo: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwZSI-ZEoUY

It provides a :Bufstop command that opens a new window at the bottom of the screen containing the list of current buffers (ordered by most recently used). Each buffer has an associated hotkey displayed besides it. When the hotkey is pressed, the buffer is loaded in preview mode (it's opened in the most recent window without closing the Bufstop window).

Bufstop is more productive than using the native :ls and :b comamnds, since it can be used to quickly preview opened files without closing the buffer list, and in general it requires less key strokes to open a buffer than other plugins.

The Bufstop window is easily dismissed with the <Esc> key.

This plugin also provides navigation history for each window. Use the :BufstopForward and :BufstopBack commands to quickly navigate the buffers in the order they were opened.

Recommended vimrc mappings for these commands:

map <leader>b :Bufstop<CR>
map <C-tab>   :BufstopBack<CR>
map <S-tab>   :BufstopForward<CR>

In addition, the following key mappings are present in the Bufstop window:

d          wipe the selected buffer.
<CR>       Open the selected buffer.
<Esc>      Dismiss the Bufstop window
k,j        Move up/down to select a buffer.
